    <p><strong>Mission:</strong><br>
    We exist to make the web navigable and usable for neurodivergent individuals, and to create a data flywheel that helps businesses understand and design for neurodivergent interaction patterns.</p>
    
    <p><strong>What We Do:</strong><br>
    We build assistive technology that reduces cognitive friction for neurodivergent users on real websites, while generating scalable behavioural insights that help businesses design better digital experiences.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Core Product:</strong></p>
    <p>B2B2C SaaS Marketplace – <strong>Latch</strong>:<br>
    • User testing by NDs at scale, via optimised focus group matching<br>
    • Immediate and regular actionable recommendations from a powerful specialised dataset<br>
    • Community & easy apply jobs for ND testers</p>
    
    <p>Chrome extension – <strong>Neuro Assist</strong>:<br>
    • Data flywheel engine<br>
    • Captures user intent before they interact with a website<br>
    • Assists users in completing tasks with clarity and reduced cognitive load<br>
    • Measures whether the website successfully supported that intent<br>
    • Aggregates anonymised data to reveal where websites fail neurodivergent users</p>
